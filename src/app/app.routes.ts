import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

export const routes: Routes = [];
// This is a placeholder for the routes of the application. You can add your routes here as needed.
// For example, if you have a HomeComponent and an AboutComponent, you can define routes like this:
// import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
// import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';
//
// export const routes: Routes = [AboutComponent, HomeComponent];
